# Apni-Farming
A multipurpose platform which helps farmers to maximise their crop yield by preventing them from various diseases like a farmer will be able to know from which disease their crops are infected. Farmer can also get information about their cattle's possible diseases if they show unusual behaviour. The last is a personalised data record of crops for decision-making in future harvesting and knowledge of profit obtained on their yield per year.

## Consist of three sections-
__1. Crop Disease Detection__:
This section will take the image as input and detect whether the given crop image is infected with any diseases or not. If it is infected, it will show all details related to disease and prevention.</br>
__2. Previous Year Crops Record__:
This section will store all the details of the obtained crop in any particular year. Like, its weather condition, fertilizers used, output, etc.To use this functionality, you must have a valid account on this portal and logging in is necessary.</br>
__3. Cattle Disease Detection__:
This section will display information about cattle diseases based on their observed symptoms.</br>

<h1>About</h1>
This model is part of my Summer Project at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior. I chose to build a model for two purposes: to help farmers grow healthy crops and make better decisions based on previous records. I used machine learning API for crop health monitoring, and for storing previous records, I used open source
tools, i.e. MERN Stack.
